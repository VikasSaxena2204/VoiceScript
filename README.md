## Project Structure

### HTML File (`index.html`)

This file provides the foundational structure of the web page, including:
- **Header:** Displays the app's logo and title.
- **Speech-to-Text Section:** Contains the UI for selecting the language, converting speech to text, and displaying action buttons.
- **External Script References:** Links to external JavaScript files (`languages-option.js` and `script.js`) for managing language options and speech-to-text conversion.

### CSS File (`style.css`)

Responsible for the visual styling and layout of the application, which includes:
- **Font and Styling:** Uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts for modern typography.
- **Color Scheme:** Defines custom color variables for background gradients and box shadows to enhance the interface.
- **Responsive Layout:** Styles that ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Interactivity:** Adds hover effects, transitions, and animations to improve user experience.

### JavaScript File (`script.js`)

Handles the main functionality of the Speech-to-Text converter:
- **`languagesOption()`**: Populates the language selection dropdown with available languages.
- **`speechToText()`**: Initializes the Web Speech API and starts the speech-to-text conversion.
- **`stopRecording()`**: Stops speech recognition when the user ends the transcription.
- **`hideBtns()`**: Hides action buttons when no text is available.
- **`download()`**: Allows the user to download the transcribed text as a `.txt` file.

### JavaScript File (`languages-option.js`)

Contains a list of available languages for speech recognition:
- **Languages Array:** Defines various language codes and names, allowing users to select their preferred language for transcription.

## How It Works

1. **Language Selection:** Users can choose a language for the speech-to-text conversion from a dropdown populated by `languages-option.js`.
2. **Speech Recognition:** Upon clicking the "Start" button, the Web Speech API activates the device's microphone, converting speech into text.
3. **Text Display:** The transcribed text is displayed immediately in a text area.
4. **Actions:**
   - **Copy:** Users can copy the transcribed text to their clipboard.
   - **Download:** Users can download the text as a `.txt` file.
   - **Clear:** Clears the text area to start over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the user interface.
- **CSS:** For styling the web page, ensuring responsiveness and a polished look.
- **JavaScript:** For managing user interactions, speech recognition, and file management.
- **Web Speech API:** For real-time speech-to-text conversion.
